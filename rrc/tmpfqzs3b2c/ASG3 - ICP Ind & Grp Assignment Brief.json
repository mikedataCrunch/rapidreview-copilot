The objective of this assessment is to\nassess you and your team\u2019s ability draw on the concepts and knowledge gained from past\nmodules to re-evaluate their current prototype and make significant improvements for this\nassignment.\nStudents are to continue working in the same team for this assignment unless indicated\notherwise by the tutor. Students are encouraged to be industry ready by obtaining completion\nbadges.\nAssignment 3 POC is an improvement of Assignment 2 prototype.\n1. Plan, design POC Solution: Execute POC solution using industry partner cloud-based\nplatform.\n2. Visualize the POC solution: Use Power BI to create a visualization dashboard to tell a\ndata story.\n3.
