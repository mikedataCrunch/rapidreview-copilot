The recursive feature elimination technique was used to evaluate the maintenance of model performance\nwhen clinical and laboratory variables were eliminated. Using populations based on hypothetical patient influx scenarios,\ndiscrete-event simulation was performed to find an optimal threshold within limited resource environments that minimizes\nmortality rates.\nResults: The cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the baseline XGBoost model\nthat utilized all 37 variables was 0.965 for OSCI \u22656. Compared to the baseline model\u2019s performance, the AUROC of the\nfeature-eliminated model that utilized 17 variables was maintained at 0.963 with statistical insignificance. Optimal thresholds\nwere found to minimize mortality rates in a hypothetical patient influx scenario. The benefit of utilizing an optimal triage threshold\nwas clear, reducing mortality up to 18.1%, compared with the conventional Youden index.\nConclusions: Our adaptive triage model and its threshold optimization capability revealed that COVID-19 management can be\nachieved via the cooperation of both the medical and health care management sectors for maximum treatment efficacy.
