The medical community sees screening patients to identify and treat prediabetes and diabetes early as an\nimportant goal; however, universal population screening is operationally not feasible, and screening policies need to take\ncharacteristics of the patient population into account. For instance, the screening policy for a population in an affluent\nneighborhood may differ from that of a safety-net hospital. The problem of optimal diabetes screening\u2014whom to screen\nand when to screen\u2014is clearly important, and small improvements could have an enormous impact. However, the prob-\nlem is typically only discussed from a practical viewpoint in the medical literature; a thorough theoretical framework\nfrom an operational viewpoint is largely missing. In this study, we propose an approach that builds on multiple methods\n\u2014partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), hidden Markov model (HMM), and predictive risk modeling\n(PRM). It uses available clinical information, in the form of electronic health records (EHRs), on specific patient popula-\ntions to derive an optimal policy, which is used to generate screening decisions, individualized for each patient. The\nPOMDP model, used for determining optimal decisions, lies at the core of our approach. We use HMM to estimate the\ncohort-specific progression of diabetes (i.e., transition probability matrix) and the emission matrix. We use PRM to gener-\nate observations\u2014in the form of individualized risk scores\u2014for the POMDP. Both HMM and PRM are learned from EHR\ndata. Our approach is unique because (i) it introduces a novel way of incorporating predictive modeling into a formal\ndecision framework to derive an optimal screening policy; and (ii) it is based on real clinical data. We fit our model using\ndataon a cohort ofmore than 60,000 patients over 5 yearsfrom a large safety-net healthsystem andthen demonstrate the\nmodel\u2019s utility by conducting a simulation study. The results indicate that our proposed screening policy outperforms\nexisting guidelines widely used in clinical practice. Our estimates suggest that implementing our policy for the studied\ncohort would add one quality-adjusted life year for every patient, and at a cost that is 35% lower, compared with existing\nguidelines. Ourproposed framework isgeneralizable toother chronic diseases,such as cancer andHIV.\nKeywords: healthcare operations;partially observable MDP;machine learning; type2 diabetes\nHistory:Received: September 2019;revised February2021,Accepted: March2021by SergeiSavin, after 3 revisions.\n*Corresponding author.\nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound and mortality worldwide.
