This\npaper presents a novel application of ML within the simulation to improve patient flow within an emergency\ndepartment (ED). An ML model used within a real ED simulation model to quantify the effect of detouring a patient\nout of the ED on the length of stay (LOS) and door-to-doctor time (DTDT) as a response to the prediction of patient\nadmission to the hospital from the ED. The ML model trained using a set of six features including the patient age,\narrival day, arrival hour of the day, and the triage level. The prediction model used a decision tree (DT) model, which\nis trained using historical data achieves a 75% accuracy. The set of rules extracted from the DT are coded within the\nsimulation model. Given a certain probability of free inpatient beds, the predicted admitted patient is then pulled out\nfrom the ED to inpatient units to alleviate the crowding within the ED. The used policy combined with adding specific\nED resources achieve 9.39% and 8.18% reduction in LOS and DTDT, respectively.\nKEYWORDS: Healthcare systems, Emergency department, Simulation, Machine learning techniques,\nmanagement.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe hospital system is a network of interconnected units:\nED, intensive care unit (ICU), operating rooms (OR), and\ninpatient nursing units (NU) (Kolker, 2013). EDs face\nsignificant challenges regarding patient delay and safety\n(Yarmohammadian et al., 2017). A significant portion of\nadmission to different hospital inpatient units (IU) is The use of machine learning in conjunction with\ncoming from the ED (Morganti et al., 2013). Given the simulation models is gaining a lot of attention in the last\nscarce ED resources, a significant amount of research has few years (Greasley and Edwards, 2019). Greasley and\nbeen done to investigate methods to decrease the length of Edwards (2019) present a recent review for studies of\nstay and streamline flows at EDs. combining simulation with big data analytics.

Therefore, many mechanisms combine ML, simulation, and optimization to improve ED\nhave been developed to mitigate the ED overcrowding as operations. In their study, the authors utilized patient\nstudying different process changes and their effects characteristics, demographics, hospital operations,\nthrough simulation (e.g., Hussein et al., 2017). socioeconomic status, clinical information, and disease\nbehavioral patterns to predict patient ED readmission.\nGartner and Padman (2020) studied the factors associated\nwith the perception of waiting time, i.e., under, over, or\ncorrect estimation of the waiting times.
