In medical practice, nested test-and-treat strategies are common to improve cost-effectiveness. For example, for patients at risk of prostate cancer, only patients who have high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) need a biopsy, which is costly and invasive, to confirm the diagnosis and help determine the treatment if needed. A decision about treatment happens after the biopsy, and is thus nested within the decision of whether to do the test. However, current existing statistical methods are not able to accommodate such a naturally embedded property of the treatment decision within the test decision. Therefore, we developed a new statistical learning method, step-adjusted tree-based reinforcement learning, to evaluate DTRs within such a nested multistage dynamic decision framework using observational data. At each step within each stage, we combined the robust semiparametric estimation via augmented inverse probability weighting with a tree-based reinforcement learning method to deal with the counterfactual optimization. The simulation studies demonstrated robust performance of the proposed methods under different scenarios. We further applied our method to evaluate the necessity of prostate biopsy and identify the optimal test-and-treat regimes for prostate cancer patients using data from the Johns Hopkins University prostate cancer active surveillance dataset.", "publicationTitle": "STATISTICS IN MEDICINE", "volume": "40", "issue": "27", "pages": "6164-6177", "date": "2021 NOV 30", "series": "", "seriesTitle": "", "seriesText": "", "journalAbbreviation": "", "language": "", "DOI": "10.1002/sim.9177", "ISSN": "", "shortTitle": "", "url": "", "accessDate": "", "archive": "", "archiveLocation": "WOS:000693136600001", "libraryCatalog": "", "callNumber": "", "rights": "", "extra": "Number: 27", "tags": [{"tag": "30 shortlist"}, {"tag": "PASSED"}, {"tag": "RESCREEN_FINAL"}, {"tag": "SOURCE_DB: WEBOFSCIENCE"}, {"tag": "notion"}], "collections": ["9XFKJ5KL"], "relations": {"owl:sameAs": "http://zotero.org/groups/5034107/items/2VYNV82C", "dc:replaces": "http://zotero.org/groups/5306491/items/KCFQSCTK"}, "dateAdded": "2023-11-30T02:16:34Z", "dateModified": "2023-11-30T03:45:53Z"}, {"key": "9K4V2GTN", "version": 54, "itemType": "journalArticle", "title": "Predicting emergency department orders with multilabel machine learning techniques and simulating effects on length of stay", "creators": [{"creatorType": "author", "firstName": "HS", "lastName": "Hunter-Zinck"}, {"creatorType": "author", "firstName": "JS", "lastName": "Peck"}, {"creatorType": "author", "firstName": "TD", "lastName": "Strout"}, {"creatorType": "author", "firstName": "SA", "lastName": "Gaehde"}], "abstractNote": "Objective: Emergency departments (EDs) continue to pursue optimal patient flow without sacrificing quality of care. The speed with which a healthcare provider receives pertinent information, such as results from clinical orders, can impact flow. We seek to determine if clinical ordering behavior can be predicted at triage during an ED visit.\nMaterials and Methods: Using data available during triage, we trained multilabel machine learning classifiers to predict clinical orders placed during an ED visit. We benchmarked 4 classifiers with 2 multilabel learning frameworks that predict orders independently (binary relevance) or simultaneously (random k-labelsets). We evaluated algorithm performance, calculated variable importance, and conducted a simple simulation study to examine the effects of algorithm implementation on length of stay and cost.\nResults: Aggregate performance across orders was highest when predicting orders independently with a multilayer perceptron (median F-1 score = 0.56), but prediction frameworks that simultaneously predict orders for a visit enhanced predictive performance for correlated orders. Visit acuity was the most important predictor for most orders. Simulation results indicated that direct implementation of the model would increase ordering costs (from $21 to $45 per visit) but reduce length of stay (from 158 minutes to 151 minutes) over all visits.\nDiscussion: Simulated implementations of the predictive algorithm decreased length of stay but increased ordering costs.

Objective: The aim of this study was to optimize the parameters of a sepsis prediction model within distinct patient groups to minimize the excess cost of sepsis care and analyze the potential effect of factors contributing to end-user response to sepsis alerts on overall model utility. Methods: We calculated the excess costs of sepsis to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) by comparing patients with and without a secondary sepsis diagnosis but with the same primary diagnosis and baseline comorbidities. We optimized the parameters of a sepsis prediction algorithm across different diagnostic categories to minimize these excess costs. At the optima, we evaluated diagnostic odds ratios and analyzed the impact of compliance factors such as noncompliance, treatment efficacy, and tolerance for false alarms on the net benefit of triggering sepsis alerts. Results: Compliance factors significantly contributed to the net benefit of triggering a sepsis alert. However, a customized deployment policy can achieve a significantly higher diagnostic odds ratio and reduced costs of sepsis care. Implementing our optimization routine with powerful predictive models could result in US $4.6 billion in excess cost savings for CMS. Conclusions: We designed a framework for customizing sepsis alert protocols within different diagnostic categories to minimize excess costs and analyzed model performance as a function of false alarm tolerance and compliance with model recommendations. We provide a framework that CMS policymakers could use to recommend minimum adherence rates to the early recognition and appropriate care of sepsis that is sensitive to hospital department-level incidence rates and national excess costs.

Such AI-based prioritization software is known as computer-aided triage and notification (CADt). Their main benefit is to speed up radiological review of images with time-sensitive findings. However, as CADt devices become more common in clinical workflows, there is still a lack of quantitative methods to evaluate a device's effectiveness in saving patients' waiting times. In this paper, we present a mathematical framework based on queueing theory to calculate the average waiting time per patient image before and after a CADt device is used. We study four workflow models with multiple radiologists (servers) and priority classes for a range of AI diagnostic performance, radiologist's reading rates, and patient image (customer) arrival rates. Due to model complexity, an approximation method known as the Recursive Dimensionality Reduction technique is applied. We define a performance metric to measure the device's time-saving effectiveness. A software tool is developed to simulate clinical workflow of image review/interpretation, to verify theoretical results, and to provide confidence intervals of the performance metric we defined. It is shown quantitatively that a triage device is more effective in a busy, short-staffed setting, which is consistent with our clinical intuition and simulation results.

Results: In the base case scenario CT + AI resulted in a negative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as compared to CT only, showing lower costs and higher effectiveness.

Design Computer simulation modelling and machine learning. Setting Seven acute stroke units. Participants Anonymised clinical audit data for 7864 patients. Results Three factors were pivotal in governing thrombolysis use: (1) the proportion of patients with a known stroke onset time (range 44%-73%), (2) pathway speed (for patients arriving within 4 hours of onset: per-hospital median arrival-to-scan ranged from 11 to 56 min; median scan-to-thrombolysis ranged from 21 to 44 min) and (3) predisposition to use thrombolysis (thrombolysis use ranged from 31% to 52% for patients with stroke scanned with 30 min left to administer thrombolysis). A pathway simulation model could predict the potential benefit of improving individual stages of the clinical pathway speed, whereas a machine learning model could predict the benefit of \u00e2 \u20ac exporting' clinical decision making from one hospital to another, while allowing for differences in patient population between hospitals. By applying pathway simulation and machine learning together, we found a realistic ceiling of 15%-25% use of thrombolysis across different hospitals and, in the seven hospitals studied, a realistic opportunity to double the number of patients with no significant disability that may be attributed to thrombolysis. Conclusions National clinical audit may be enhanced by a combination of pathway simulation and machine learning, which best allows for an understanding of key levers for improvement in hyperacute stroke pathways, allowing for differences between local patient populations. These models, based on standard clinical audit data, may be applied at scale while providing results at individual hospital level.

The medical community sees screening patients to identify and treat prediabetes and diabetes early as an important goal; however, universal population screening is operationally not feasible, and screening policies need to take characteristics of the patient population into account. For instance, the screening policy for a population in an affluent neighborhood may differ from that of a safety-net hospital. The problem of optimal diabetes screening-whom to screen and when to screen-is clearly important, and small improvements could have an enormous impact. However, the problem is typically only discussed from a practical viewpoint in the medical literature; a thorough theoretical framework from an operational viewpoint is largely missing. In this study, we propose an approach that builds on multiple methods-partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), hidden Markov model (HMM), and predictive risk modeling (PRM). It uses available clinical information, in the form of electronic health records (EHRs), on specific patient populations to derive an optimal policy, which is used to generate screening decisions, individualized for each patient. The POMDP model, used for determining optimal decisions, lies at the core of our approach. We use HMM to estimate the cohort-specific progression of diabetes (i.e., transition probability matrix) and the emission matrix. We use PRM to generate observations-in the form of individualized risk scores-for the POMDP. Both HMM and PRM are learned from EHR data. Our approach is unique because (i) it introduces a novel way of incorporating predictive modeling into a formal decision framework to derive an optimal screening policy; and (ii) it is based on real clinical data. We fit our model using data on a cohort of more than 60,000 patients over 5 years from a large safety-net health system and then demonstrate the model's utility by conducting a simulation study. The results indicate that our proposed screening policy outperforms existing guidelines widely used in clinical practice. Our estimates suggest that implementing our policy for the studied cohort would add one quality-adjusted life year for every patient, and at a cost that is 35% lower, compared with existing guidelines.

We propose a model for simulating the selection of patients over time by a clinician using a machine learning algorithm, and quantifying the expected patient outcomes and cost savings.

This problem is adversely affecting the safety of the patients who rely on receiving a timely treatment in EDs. As a part of solving this problem, a triage process is utilized. Triage is a pre-hospital process by which patients are sorted according to the severity of their illnesses or injuries. Improvements to this process would affect the patient flow positively, and in turn would enhance patient satisfaction and quality of care. In a previous study, we developed a triage algorithm that uses Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) to rank the patients according to their characteristics: chief complaint, age, gender, pain level, and vital signs. The main purpose of this study is to compare two triage systems using Discrete Event Simulation (DES); one system uses the typical Emergency Severity Index (ESI), and the other uses the FAHP and MAUT algorithm. Overall, there was no strong statistical evidence that either system would do better than the other for all the performance measures when the average is taken across all ESI levels. On the other hand, the collected simulated data by each ESI level showed that the FAHP-MAUT algorithm tends to balance the time-to-bed (TTB) and length of stay (LOS) for ESI levels 2-5. In terms of the percentage of tardy patients, FAHP-MAUT system significantly outperforms the ESI system for ESI levels 4 and 5; 34% vs. 61% and 25% vs. 70%, respectively. Both systems were performing about equally for ESI level 1 and level 3 patients; 25% vs. 26% and 64% vs. 67%. respectively. While ESI system slightly outperforms FAHP-MAUT system for ESI level 2 patients, 56% vs. 66%. Based on these results, we recommend using FAHP-MAUT not only because it performs better in terms of minimizing the number of patients with longer than the allotted upper limits of wait times, but also it reduces potential bias and errors in decision making in clinical settings; and thus, it can be used as the basis of an expert system to advise triage nurses.
